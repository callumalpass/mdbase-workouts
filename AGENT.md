## Profile-First Approach

**Always read `data/my-profile.md` first** when making workout recommendations or creating plans.

The profile contains:
- Training history and preferences
- Current goals (daily training default, bench PR beyond 55kg, beat 33-week streak)
- Favorite exercises and programming patterns
- Session templates (minimum session, bench day, dip day)
- Equipment access and limitations
- Consistency strategies

Use this information to make personalized, contextual recommendations rather than generic workout advice.
